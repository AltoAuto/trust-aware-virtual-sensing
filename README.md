# Trust-Aware Virtual Sensing + Supervisory DCV (Building 59)

Turn noisy CO₂ + BAS signals into **trusted estimates + confidence**, then use them in a **constraint-based ventilation supervisor** to meet IAQ limits with minimum energy — robust to sensor drift + missing data.

## Why?
Smart-building sensing for control runs into practical blockers:

- occupant sensing accuracy is often insufficient for closed-loop control
- “peel-and-stick” sensing (easy-to-deploy add-on sensors) hits power/wiring/maintenance limits
- virtual sensing must propagate uncertainty from sensor errors into control decisions

This project is built to survive those realities

## Objective 
Estimate **CO₂ generation rate** G(t) (preferred over headcount) and related latent ventilation effectiveness/rate (as needed), with **uncertainty**, then use a **constraint-based DCV supervisor** to:
- keep CO₂ below limits (with confidence-aware constraints)
- minimize ventilation energy
- outperform rule baselines (raw CO₂-threshold DCV and schedule-based ventilation)

under sensor drift, missing data, and messy BAS signals.

## Dataset

This project uses the **LBNL Building 59** dataset (Dryad, **DOI: 10.7941/D1N33Q**), a curated **3-year** BAS-style operational dataset from an **office building (built 2015) in Berkeley, CA**. The dataset covers HVAC operating conditions, indoor/outdoor environmental variables, energy/end-use metering, and occupant counts, collected from **300+ sensors/meters** across two office floors.

### What’s included (from the Dryad release)
- `Building_59.zip` — cleaned time-series CSVs + Brick model (`.ttl`) + metadata JSON
- `data_description_table_3year_clean_data.xlsx` — per-point catalog (file/column descriptions, units, missingness, availability)
- `metadata_Dryad_Bldg59.docx` and `README_Dryad_Bldg59.txt` — dataset notes and structure :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
### Download
1) Download `Building_59.zip` from Dryad [https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.7941/D1N33Q]
2) Unzip into `Building_59`
3) Run:
   python src/build_layer0.py

## Roadmap (Layers)
- Layer 0 — point contract: map Brick points → (file, time_col, value_col) and export a canonical table
- Layer 1 — DataQA/Trust: missingness, drift detection, range checks, unit checks, timestamp sanity, point identity (cmd/fbk/meas)
- Layer 2 — Minimal zone CO₂ model: define dynamics + inputs from BAS
- Layer 3 — Estimation (primary): MHE (and EKF/UKF baselines) for G(t) under noise/missingness
- Layer 4 — Supervisory DCV: constraint handling with uncertainty-aware margins
- Layer 5 — Evaluation: stress tests (drift, dropouts), IAQ violations, energy proxies, estimator calibration

## Outputs (what this repo will produce)
- `point_contract.yaml` (signals + brick_points with metadata + preprocessing rules)
- `layer0.csv` (canonical time-aligned table)
- Layer 1 reports: missingness heatmap, drift flags, trust scores
- Layer 3 estimates: G(t) with uncertainty bands
- Layer 4 results: CO₂ constraint satisfaction vs energy proxy + baseline comparisons
